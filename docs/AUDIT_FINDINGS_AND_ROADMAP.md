## 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Service Role Key Exposure Risk
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Impact: Security vulnerability**

**Problem:** Service role keys are being used in client-accessible code paths.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/lib/auth-utils.ts:201`
- `src/app/api/teams/route.ts:72-78`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Create dedicated service operations API
mkdir -p src/app/api/admin
touch src/app/api/admin/service-operations/route.ts

# 2. Move all service role operations to server-only endpoints
# 3. Add environment variable validation
touch src/lib/env-validation.ts
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `src/lib/env-validation.ts`:
```typescript
const requiredServerEnvVars = ['SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY'] as const
const requiredClientEnvVars = ['NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL', 'NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'] as const

export function validateServerEnvironment() {
  // Server-side validation only
}
```

2. Refactor service operations to dedicated API endpoints
3. Remove service role key usage from client-accessible code

## ⚡ Performance Issues (High Priority)

### 1. Missing Database Indexes
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Impact: Performance degradation at scale**

**Problem:** Missing composite indexes for multi-tenant queries will cause performance issues as data grows.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Add to new migration file
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_reviews_team_employee_created 
ON reviews(team_id, employee_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_points_team_employee_updated 
ON points(team_id, employee_id, updated_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_team_members_user_role 
ON team_members(user_id, role) INCLUDE (team_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_active_team_members 
ON team_members(team_id) WHERE role IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. N+1 Query Problems
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Impact: Unnecessary API calls**

**Problem:** Dashboard and Leaderboard components make separate API calls.

**Solution:** Create combined API endpoint for dashboard data.

---

## 🔧 Moderate Improvements (Medium Priority)

### 1. Component Optimization
**Files:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/submit-review/page.tsx`

**Action Items:**
