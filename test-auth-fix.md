# Authentication Fix Testing

## Issue Description
Users assigned to teams were getting stuck in an infinite authentication loop with repeated "checkUser called" messages in the console.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. useAuth Hook Improvements (src/hooks/useAuth.ts)
- ✅ **Added debouncing** (100ms) to prevent rapid successive `checkUser()` calls
- ✅ **Simplified auth state handling** to only respond to SIGNED_IN, TOKEN_REFRESHED, and SIGNED_OUT events
- ✅ **Enhanced race condition protection** with better guard mechanisms
- ✅ **Added RLS fallback profiles** using auth metadata when database access fails
- ✅ **Improved error handling** with detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Database RLS Policy Fix (supabase/migrations/012_fix_user_self_access_rls.sql)
- ✅ **Prioritizes user self-access** over team membership checks
- ✅ **Ensures users can ALWAYS access their own profile** regardless of team status
- ✅ **Simplified team visibility logic** to reduce complex nested queries
- ✅ **Maintains team isolation** while fixing the auth loop

## Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Development server running on http://localhost:3001
2. Test with user email: `nmang004@gmail.com` (or any team-assigned user)

### Expected Results

#### Before Fix:
- ❌ Infinite "checkUser called" messages in console
- ❌ Login stuck in loading state for team-assigned users
- ❌ Authentication failures due to RLS policy conflicts

#### After Fix:
- ✅ Single, controlled authentication flow
- ✅ Successful login for users assigned to teams
- ✅ Fallback profile creation when database access is restricted
- ✅ Clean console logs with proper error handling

### Test Procedure
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3001/login
2. Enter credentials for team-assigned user
3. Monitor browser console for auth messages
4. Verify successful login without infinite loops
5. Check that user profile loads correctly

## Technical Details

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Debounced checkUser()**: Prevents rapid successive authentication calls
2. **Event filtering**: Only responds to relevant auth state changes
3. **Enhanced guards**: Prevents multiple simultaneous auth operations
4. **RLS fallback**: Creates user profile from auth metadata when database blocked
5. **Simplified RLS policy**: Prioritizes self-access over complex team queries

### Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Main authentication logic fixes
- `supabase/migrations/012_fix_user_self_access_rls.sql` - Database policy fix
